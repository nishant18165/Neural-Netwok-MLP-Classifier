# Neural-Netwok-MLP-Classifier
In this work I have Implemented MLP Classifier(Neural Network) using Backpropagation technique from scratch. In the Implementation I have used different-different activation function like 'tanh','sigmoid','relu' and 'linear' to train the mlp model. In the end i have also compare the accuracy obtained by my model with the sklearn mlp classifier, the accuracy obtained using both the classifiers on mnist dataset is approximately same.
